## Reminders


    
+ (By Sept 8th 10pm) Turn in the Week 3 Reading Reflections.  
    + Read the initial articles assigned to your group.



---

## Plan for Today: Lab Day

* Get started working on your project and with your project's data
* Define and refine your research questions

---

## Initial Project Meeting with Stakeholder

* Make sure you are on-time.  If you will be a couple of minutes late (e.g., coming from a class across campus), make sure to inform me ahead of time.

* Team Leader: Take notes and run the meeting.

* Everyone: Make eye contact.  Create a positive environment.

* Structure of the meeting
    + Do quick introductions.
    + Ask the stakeholder to explain the project and their goals.
        + Listen carefully and ask follow-up questions.
    + Ask questions from your initial readings (charter, article) and exploring of the data.
    + Set next meeting (between Sept 22nd and Oct 1st).

---

## .gitignore

When you open your group project folder in Positron, make sure to pull.  I have added a .gitignore file.  

* .gitignore: Tells git what files to NOT push to GitHub.
    + Put any data in the **datafiles** sub-folder so that it isn't pushed to GitHub.


---

## Lab Work

* Access the "DataFirstSteps.Qmd" in the Activities folder on our `class-site` GitHub repository.

* Work on question formulation.
  + Group progress is due on Gradescope by 10am next Thursday (Sept 11th).
* Start engaging with the data.
  + Means a lot of different things for the different groups.
  + I provide group specific advice in the "DataFirstSteps.Qmd" document.
