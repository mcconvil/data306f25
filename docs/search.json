    "text": "Git Collaboration: Merge conflicts\n\nWhat if my collaborators and I both make changes?\n\nScenario: Your collaborator makes changes to a file, commits, and pushes to GitHub. You also modify that file, commit and push.\n\nResult: Your push will fail because there’s a commit on GitHub that you don’t have.\n\nUsual Solution: Pull and usually git will merge their work nicely with yours. Then push. If that doesn’t work, you have a merge conflict. Let’s cross that bridge when we get there.\n\nHow to avoid merge conflicts?\n\nAlways pull when you are going to work on your project.\nAlways commit and push when you are done even if you made small changes."
