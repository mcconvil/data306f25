All statistical practitioners are expected to follow these guidelines and encourage others to do the same.\n\n\nIn some situations, guideline principles may require balancing competing interests.

Society benefits from informed judgments supported by ethical statistical practice. All statistical practitioners are expected to follow these guidelines and encourage others to do the same.\n\n\nIn some situations, guideline principles may require balancing competing interests. If an unexpected ethical challenge arises, the ethical practitioner seeks guidance, not exceptions, in the guidelines. To justify unethical behaviors, or to exploit gaps in the guidelines, is unprofessional and inconsistent with these guidelines.”"

When asked whether or not the researchers had tried to anonymize the data, the researchers said “No. Data is already public” and “Some may object to the ethics of gathering and releasing this data. However, all the data found in the dataset are or were already publicly available, so releasing this dataset merely presents it is a more useful form.”\n\nWhat is your reaction to the researchers’ statement?\nDo you think users of social media platforms are adequately informed as to how their data might be collected, stored, and used?\nWho benefits from this type of large-scale collection of personal data?

Who is harmed?

Statisticians should recognize that statistical practice could adversely affect groups or the public perception of groups, including marginalized groups. Statisticians should contemplate, and be sensitive to, the manner in which information is framed to avoid disproportionate harm to vulnerable groups.”\n\nIn the article “Racial Health Disparities and Covid-19—Caution and Context”, the authors argue that while it is important to document racial disparity data, such data need to be contextualized with adequate analysis in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Suppose you were tasked with creating an interactive map of COVID data. What additional context would be important to provide as an ethical data scientist?\nWho will be impacted by your project? How will they benefit? How might they be harmed? What can your team do to minimize the harms and maximize the benefits?"
