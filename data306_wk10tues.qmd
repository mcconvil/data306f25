## Elevator Speeches

* **Come to class with 2 versions** (one for educated non-expert and one for general public).
    + Make sure to give your name, year, and major.
    + Pick a data project for your speech.  (It can be your 306 project, summer work, DCDS project, etc.)
    + Follow the advice in the readings for the week.
    + Make sure to avoid jargon and only provide technical information if needed.
    + Connect your project to broad interest.
    + Each speech should be 2 - 3 minutes long and make sure to speak at a reasonable pace.
    + Be ready for a follow-up question.  
    
* Incorporate feedback and then create a recording of both your speeches.  
    + Upload to Google Drive.  Share the link with me via Google Drive and on Gradescope.
    + Due by 10am next Tuesday (November 4th).
