## Reminders/Tasks

* Readings in the Schedule are updated for the next few weeks.

* Data dictionaries due by Thursday at 10am in project repository.

* Have shared your presentations.  Watch your own group's video and fill out ALL SIX QUESTIONS from the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd3UUOzJ4bfh158OQUrXgJZx0RRzdQ1KVBqGWuzBPHc/copy)

## Plan for Today

* How do we know if our group is at a good place in the project?
    + Have a solid understanding of the research problem.
    + Have your data.
    + Have a clear path forward.
    + Are making good progress both in and out of class each week.
    
* First 10 minutes of class: In your project groups, clean up your Project To Dos on GitHub.  Come up with several **concrete** tasks for this week.

* Data dictionaries should be one of those tasks: 
    + Due in your repo by 10am on Thursday.

## Example Tasks


+ Create 20 exploratory graphs and relate back to research question/problem.
+ Determine and complete data cleaning tasks (e.g., collapse categorical variable into coarser bins, join datasets, recode -99s to NA, ...).
+ Make sure everyone on the team (including Kelly) has the cleaned, wrangled dataset.  Make sure the script that outlines all wrangling steps is included in the repository.
+ Create a data dictionary and share in our GitHub repository.
+ Split data into training and testing splits.  Make sure everyone on the team (including Kelly) has access and the script to split the data is the repository.
+ Determine model form and variables to include in models.  (Check with Kelly before moving to modeling.)
+ Genomics: Start creating protocol for processing genes with otb.
+ AI Personas: Create more "representative" Bucknell personas.  Give personas part of the MyVoice survey.  Compare closed and open question responses to the true results.
