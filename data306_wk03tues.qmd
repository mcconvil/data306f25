## Reminders

+ New team leaders this week.
    + Remember to update the To Dos list your GitHub Project.

+ (By Sept 11th 10am) Turn in your Question Formulation document on Gradescope.
    + Week 2 Team Leader should turn it in for the whole team.

+ (By Sept 15th 10pm) Turn in the Week 4 Reading Reflections.

## Plan for Today

* Topics to discuss:
    + Confirmatory studies versus exploratory studies
    + Exploratory data analysis    

* Demos in Positron

* EDA activity

---

## Types of Data Projects

What is the difference between confirmatory and exploratory studies?

::: columns

::: column

**Confirmatory Studies**

* Classical view of statistical process

* Start with hypotheses and then use data to assess the accuracy of the hypotheses.

:::

::: column

**Exploratory Studies**

* Start with the data and use the data to generate hypotheses.

:::

:::

::: fragment
Questions:
:::

* Pros and cons of each type?
* Under which type does your project fall?

---

## Avoiding Overfitting the Data/P-Hacking in Exploratory Studies

::: columns

::: column

::: { .nonincremental}

* Split your data into two sets:
    + Training set: Data to mine
    + Test set: Data to apply your final models to.

:::

:::

::: column

![](img/train_test.png)

:::

:::

* Typically 70/30 or 80/20 split.

* **Question**: How should you decide what data goes into the training set versus the test set?

# Exploratory Data Analysis

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* All studies, exploratory or confirmatory, should include a robust exploration stage.
    + Might be more constrained for confirmatory studies.

* EDA Goals:
    + Look for data quality issues (missingness, censored data, mislabeled data, representativity, ...).
    + Discover trends in the data (within one variable, between 2+ variables).

* There is no perfect checklist for EDA.  

* It is a VERY iterative process.

## General (Incomplete) EDA Checklist

**Disclaimer:** Not every item on this list will work for every project.

1. Formulate a few questions you want to answer with your explorations.  Typical questions:
    a. What type of variation occurs within the variables?
    b. What type of variation occurs between the variables?
2. Check the size of the data.  
    a. Do you have the correct number of observations and variable?
3. Spend time exploring how the data are coded.  
    a. Do the variables have the correct classification in `R` or `Python`?
4. Summarize from many angles. 
    a. What are typical values?
    b. Any red flags?  If so, explore different subsets of the data.
    c. What information is gained from these summaries?

## General (Incomplete) EDA Checklist

5. Validate with at least one external data source.
    a. Are my summaries reasonably similar to the external source?  If not, why not?
6. Make many plots.
    a. Are there any unusual patterns?  If so, what might explain them?
    b. What information is gained from these plots?
    c. Go back and compute additional summary statistics based on what you learned from the plots.
7. Tidy
    a. Determine what data wrangling steps should go into creating a tidy version of the data.
8. Try the easy solution.
    a. Try to at least partially answer some of your research questions via your EDA output.
